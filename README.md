# Capsulate

A yet another struktogram editor, this time, it's svelteðŸŽ‰.

## What is a structogram anyway?

A Structogram(or struktogram) is an algorithm visualization format, wich is (when used correctly) programming language independent.

It is heavily used in German and Hungarian universities to "write" pseudocode but instead of syntax highlight, the control elements have different visual representations.

This program is here to create widely acceptable, and intuitive way to edit, store and export these silly drawn pseudocodes.

## Targetted features

[x] Structogram in- and export to JSON format
[ ] Kotlin support might be added
[ ] Drag-and-drop statement handling
[ ] Vector image and LaTex support

## Dev mode

Once you've pulled a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
